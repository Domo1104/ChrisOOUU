On this page you are allowed to use the navbar at the top to quickly switch between sections. 

INTRO
First section is a short intro and an about section. Detailing the reason for making the page and what I hope to accomplish. 
Second is listing some of the many hobbies I have. Explaining how they either helped me, influenced me, and changed me.
Third is all the projects I've done. So far none but I can't wait to get started and learn everything there is to learn.
Fourth is an inquiry section where people can leave their name and email with a short message to ask me any questions or if they are looking for someone to help them with a website.
