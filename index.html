    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm here to tell you all a little about myself. My name is Christopher Ou(pronounced oh), and I'm 32 years old. 
            I've been interested in a lot of things since I was a child. The hobbies included are sports, cars, animals, science,
             computers, games, and much more. Please explore this webpage and I hope that you can get to know me better.
        </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned before my name is Christopher but I prefer to be called Chris and my close friends call me "Domo". I am 
            passionate with a lot of things and I recently stumbled upon programming. The thrill of completing a line of code that 
            has been nothing but trouble, the satisfaction of seeing all your "mumbo-jumbo" turn into a beautiful webpage, and the 
            comradery of working with many other skilled and talented developers is what draws me to this field.
        <br>
        <br>
            My interest for programming started very recently. I've noticed more and more people going into this field and I was 
            hooked. Taking a loot at some YouTube videos and doing freeCodeCamp was the first time I got my feet wet. Now I am 
            diving into the deep end and I want to show what I've been working on. 
        </p>
