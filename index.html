            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm here to tell you all a little about myself. My name is Christopher Ou(pronounced oh), and I'm 32 years old. 
            I've been interested in a lot of things since I was a child. The hobbies included are sports, cars, animals, science,
             computers, games, and much more. Please explore this webpage and I hope that you can get to know me better.
                </p>
            <h3>about</h3>
                <p>As I mentioned before my name is Christopher but I prefer to be called Chris and my close friends call me "Domo". I am 
                passionate with a lot of things and I recently stumbled upon programming. The thrill of completing a line of code 
                that has been nothing but trouble, the satisfaction of seeing all your "mumbo-jumbo" turn into a beautiful webpage, 
                and the comradery of working with many other skilled and talented developers is what draws me to this field.
                <br>
                <br>
                My interest for programming started very recently. I've noticed more and more people going into this field and I was 
                hooked. Taking a look at some YouTube videos and doing freeCodeCamp was the first time I got my feet wet. Now I am 
                diving into the deep end and I want to show what I've been working on. Before that, I want to highlight some hobbies 
                that have shaped me into the person I am today.

            <h3>hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are dozens of things things I love to waste my time on. Watching sports has been a good thing for me 
                    since they all promote teamwork. It has taught me the importance of communicating and the traits that make 
                    a good leader. One sport will always be my favorite. Basketball has been in my life since I was in elementary 
                    school and I still watch the NBA. Being from NYC my favorite team is the Knicks. One day I hope to see them 
                    win a championship but I know that's a lot to ask for given their track record. A boy can dream.
                        </li>
                        <li>Since I was a child I've always wanted a dog but I'm sure some of you know the struggle of convincing your 
                    parents that you are capable of taking care of one. At the time we didn't know about adopting so when my 
                    parents finally caved, we bought our first dog. His name was Jester. He was a white golden retriever or some 
                    call them English cream retriever. Unfortunately he passed some years back on May, 31st 2017. My wife 
                    and I now have an 8 year old corgi which we took in since a friend had to give her away. Her name is Eevee
                    (like the Pokemon). I even worked for North Shore Animal League and volunteered for ACC in brooklyn. My 
                    love for animals goes beyond dogs and cats but this is something that I can do. Wildlife conservation will 
                    be left to the professionals.
                        </li>
                        <li>This next hobby can be one category of computers. There's science, games, and computers in this one. 
                    Science has long been one of my favorite things to learn, mainly astrology. This is lumped in with computers 
                    because I do most of my learning on YouTube but also from research online. I only play computer games since 
                    I have an interest for computers. I understand the benefits of computer gaming like more FPS(frames per 
                    second), better graphics, more control in most games using the mouse and keyboard. I also don't discount 
                    the benefits of console gaming but it's just not for me. The interest in computers snuck up on me since this 
                    was a recent hobby. I always had a computer but my brother always built it for me. In the past few years 
                    I've upgraded all the parts in my computer myself and even helped my friend build his first computer two 
                    years ago. That was the first one I've ever built but it won't be the last.
                        </li>
                        <li>Of all the hobbies I enjoy, cars would have to be my favorite. I am in no way a professional but I do 
                    know a good amount on the subject. This has been a huge influence on my life since I've met some of my best 
                    friends from going to car meets. My main interest is on the racing side. I was a mechanic for a few 
                    years and then I quit. I went to Lincoln Tech to learn about this but I found out I enjoyed working on my 
                    own car and the modification side of things. I never wanted to work on my own car after coming home from 
                    work and that seemed to drain my love for cars. Currently I own a 2011 Subaru WRX hatchback and it has been 
                    a dream. I still have other goals to reach when it comes to cars. The realistic dream car will be a Honda 
                    S2000. The affordable dream car is the Honda/Acura NSX. The ultimate dream car is the McLaren P1 or a 720S.
